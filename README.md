What is Sloshball?
------------------

  
Sloshball is kickball with beer. A keg is used in place of second base. When runners reach second base, they must finish a cup of beer before moving on to third. However, there is no force out at third base, so an unlimited number of people can be on second base drinking beer. 

Everyone on the field must be holding a beer at all times. Fielders may not drop their beer in order to make a play on the ball. If a batter believes that a fielder is playing with an empty cup, batter may call a beer check on the fielder. If the fielder has an empty cup, he/she must drink. If the fielder made an out but was found to have no beer in their cup, the batter is safe. If there is beer in the cup, the batter who called beer check must drink. 

All close plays should result in loud, profanity laced arguments. 

If the game ends and no one has splashed beer on themselves, the game should be considered a failure.
